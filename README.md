# Gutr
ASP .NET C# MVC full CRUD 3 table

App is viewable and demoable here:
http://gutr.azurewebsites.net

No special instructions for cloning and running app locally. Should run just fine.

Stack overflow is always a great resource for working out any problems.

This project was patterned after ElevenNote, a project given to students at elevenfifty.org in the .NET course.
